Predictive maintenance for industrial equipment 
## Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based predictive maintenance system to forecast potential equipment failures. By analyzing historical maintenance data, multiple classification algorithms are used to enhance predictive accuracy and optimize maintenance scheduling, reducing downtime and operational risks.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various attributes related to industrial equipment performance, including operational conditions and failure types. It has been preprocessed to remove unnecessary columns and encode categorical variables.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)

## Approach
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Loaded and cleaned the dataset
  - Handled missing values and categorical encoding
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for pattern detection
- Feature Engineering & Selection:
  - Removed redundant columns
  - Generated relevant features for model training
- Model Training & Evaluation:
  - Trained multiple classification models
  - Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
  - Compared results to select the best-performing model

## Results
- The best-performing model was XGBOOST and Random Forest.
- The system effectively identifies potential failures, allowing proactive maintenance.

## Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning models for enhanced predictions
- Integrate real-time data streaming for dynamic maintenance alerts
- Develop a dashboard for better visualization
